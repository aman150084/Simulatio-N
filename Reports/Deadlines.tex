  \maketitle
  \section*{Creating a sample GUI}
  Should be finished by next week.
  \section*{Converting the code to CUDA}
  Time needed, seriously can't figure out how much
  \section*{Debugging}
  Will be started after initial code is written. Some debugging has been
  done on the skeleton code. We will check the data obtained from the
  sequential code already written (seq.c) and see whether the data makes
  sense. We have done some rudimentary error checking already.
  \section*{Other Work}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item We need to modify the File I/O to ensure that we print the planetArray data
    to a file in a form that would make it easier for us to take data from during
    simulation.

  \end{enumerate}
