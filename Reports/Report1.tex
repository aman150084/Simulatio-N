\section*{Summary}
Prepared a rough code which would be used in the final program.
The Code only applies to one force:Gravity
However it is still text based but prints the results unto a text file.
\section*{Detailed}

\subsection*{May 17, 2016}
Created abstract idea for main code

\subsubsection*{Arkavo Hait}
Started learning CUDA, from documentation and a tutorial (link in repo).
\subsubsection*{Sagnik Bhattacharya}
Started a course on Udacity on Parallel programming using CUDA. Completed Lesson 1: The GPU programming model.

\section{What we will do}
Convert the C code to CUDA code to be essential in Parallel computing
Create a GUI to make things visual.
Add other forces and their effects in the future.
We are still workin on the basics of CUDA programming and will covert it to CUDA language soon.
Converting the initial code to a function library to ease up the process and debugging
